Idea from snappycreeper:
https://github.com/snappycreeper/OldDiscordFont

# Discord's new font sucks

## Made for BetterDiscord but can be adapted to other discord custom clients like openasar, etc...

# Custom discord css to get the old font back
If you didn't know, discord changed its font from Whitney (Wonderful font) to GG Sans (a font created by discord that sucks).
This custom css replaces the newfont with the old one.

# Why did discord changed font?
The old font, Whitney, was not owned by discord and must be paid to be used. So discord, after years of using Whitney, decided to create its own font, GG Sans, which sucks in many ways.

# Why did I create this plugin?
A similar plugin already exists, created by snappycreeper. This plugin does the same thing only I encountered problems, this one should be bug free.
